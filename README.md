## Spelling with Say
Ever find yourself googling words when you're in the middle of a conversation?
Getting reliant on spell check funtions in your favourite processor? Or do you
generally have a bad time at spelling? If so, look no further! Oh you need OSX
with the say command.

## Why did I make this?
Really? I was bored and needed something to do. And I suck at spelling. I doubt anyone will use it, but maybe
someone will find it useful for something else.

## Setting it up
Clone the repository and run learn.sh. This will make an empty words.txt file
for you to use. Add the words you want to learn in this file. One word per
line. Once this is done run learn.sh again and off you go!

## TODO
Nothing, it's awesome.
